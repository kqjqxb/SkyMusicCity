        title: 'Why is it important not to listen to music too loudly?',
        article: "Listening to music can be a true pleasure, but it's important to remember hearing safety. Research shows that regularly listening to music at high volume levels can lead to hearing loss. Sounds above 85 decibels can damage the hair cells in the ear, resulting in noise-induced injury. For safe music listening, it is recommended to keep the volume level below 60% of the maximum and take breaks every 60 minutes. Use quality headphones that provide good sound isolation to avoid the need to increase the volume.",
